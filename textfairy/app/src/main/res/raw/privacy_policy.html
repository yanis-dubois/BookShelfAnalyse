	<p>Like thousands of other app owners, I use Google Analytics for Text Fairy. Google Analytics is a piece of software that grabs data about my visitors (you). It’s something like an advanced server log.</p>
	
	<h3>What does Google Analytics record?</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>What features of the app you are using.</li>
        	<li>How long you stay for.</li>
        	<li>What kind of device you’re using.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	<h3>What do I do with your data?</h3>
	<p>
		The tracking information allows me to better understand how people are using my app. This allows me to make better decisions about design and future features.
		No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting.
		All of my activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service.</a>
